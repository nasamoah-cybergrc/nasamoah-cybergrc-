# 👋 Hi, I’m Nana Asamoah (nasamoah-cybergrc)

An aspiring **Cybersecurity Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) Analyst** — career-changer from education to IT & security.  
I document my learning journey here: step-by-step projects, simple labs, and short write-ups that show how I learned each skill.

## What to explore first
1. `1-IT-Support-and-Networking` — my IT foundations (troubleshooting, small network setups)  
2. `2-Google-Cybersecurity-Projects` — beginner security projects and incident reports  
3. `3-IBM-GRC-Compliance-Frameworks` — risk registers, ISO 27001 mapping  
4. `6-GRC-Portfolio-Projects` — polished, short case studies I’ll feature on LinkedIn

## My goal
Tell a clear growth story: from teaching → solving tech problems → protecting systems and documenting controls.  
If you'd like to follow along, star the repos and I’ll keep updating them with small, practical projects.
